
We implemented ANS using RecBole framework, please find our method under recbole/model/general_recommender. 

We have used four different base models in this paper, and we have provided LightGCN as a version of the base model for your convenience. The code for BPR-MF, SGL, and NGCF is available to the reader with simple modifications.
